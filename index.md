# Lab Report 4 - Fixing code using vim (Week 6)
The lab report showcases how to use vim to edit and fix the errors in ListExamples.java, which is located at https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7.

1. Before we start our code fixing procedure, we have to set up the required repository. So we log into our ieng6 account first (with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account):
```
$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
2. After successfully log into the account, clone the repository from https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7 and cd into the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7
$ cd lab7
```
3. Run the test.sh file inside the file to demonstrate that ListExamples.java indeed has some errors in it.
```
$ bash test.sh
```
Here is a screenshot of the steps 1 to 3:

4. The following part demonstrates exactly how to edit the code file to fix the failing test using vim
  1. we use `vim ListExamples.java` to "vim" into the file first
  2.
