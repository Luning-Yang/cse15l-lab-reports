# Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands (Week 6)
The lab report demonstrates the usage of the command `grep` with 4 different command-line options. The directory we use for `grep` is https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/stringsearch-data. 

1. `-i` would match the lines containing a specific word in a file. Examples:
    1.  input: `grep -i "hello" stringsearch-data/technical/911report/chapter-1.txt`<br>
        output: `At 10:39, the Vice President updated the Secretary on the air threat conference: Vice President: There's been at least three instances here where we've had reports of aircraft approaching Washington-a couple were confirmed hijack. And, pursuant to the President's instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out. Hello?`
