# Lab Report 4 - Fixing code using vim (Week 6)
The lab report showcases how to use vim to edit and fix the errors in ListExamples.java, which is located at https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7.

1. Before we start our code fixing procedure, we have to set up the required repository. So we log into our ieng6 account first (with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account):
```
$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
