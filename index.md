# Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands (Week 6)
The lab report showcases the implementation of the `grep` command with four different command-line options. The `grep` command is used on the directory located at https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/stringsearch-data.

1. `-i` would match the lines containing a specific word in a file. <br>
    Examples: <br>
    1.  The following example searches for and returns all lines which contain the string *hello* in the given file:<br>
        input: `grep -i "hello" stringsearch-data/technical/911report/chapter-1.txt`<br>
        output: ```At 10:39, the Vice President updated the Secretary on the air threat conference: Vice President: There's been at least three instances here where we've had reports of aircraft approaching Washington-a couple were confirmed hijack. And, pursuant to the President's instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out. Hello?```
   2. The following example searches for and returns all lines which contain the string *using* in the given file:<br>
        input: `grep -i "using" stringsearch-data/technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt`<br>
        output: ```for all subjects using a baseline home interview, an
          report results using only the simpler definition.

        measures of YHL. Using either YOL or YHL, however, we found

2. `-r` will match and return the lines containing a specific word in **all** files under the given directory and its subdirectories. <br>
    Examples: <br>
    1.  The following example searches for and returns all lines which contain the string *vegetables* in all files under and the given directory and its subdirectories:<br>
        input: `grep -r "vegetables" stringsearch-data/technical/biomed` <br>
        output: ```stringsearch-data/technical/biomed/bcr583.txt:        were grouped according to type (fruits, vegetables, dairy,

    2.  The following example searches for and returns all lines which contain the string *cannot* in all files under and the given directory and its subdirectories:<br>
        input: `grep -r "fruit" stringsearch-data/technical/government` <br>
        output: ```stringsearch-data/technical/government/About_LSC/Strategic_report.txt:also witnessed the fruition of prior efforts.

3. `-v` would match all lines except the lines containing a specific word in a file. <br>
    1. The following example searches for and returns all lines which do **not** contain the string *t* in the given file:<br>
    input: `grep -v "t" stringsearch-data/technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt` <br>
